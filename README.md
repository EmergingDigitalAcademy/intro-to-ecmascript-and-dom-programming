# Welcome to the Intro to ECMAScript workshop

This is a hands-on workshop. We're going to build a number guessing
game. Some concepts that we'll cover:

  - Basic introduction to html and css (just enough to be dangerous)
  - Review of how javascript, html, and css all link together in `index.html`
  - Review of how the Document Object Model works (DOM)
  - Review of HTML5 input elements and forms
  - ECMAScript6 Features:
    - Code comments
    - data types: strings, numbers, integers, booleans
    - `let` and `const`
    - `forEach` loops
    - String templates (backtick format)
    - arrow functions and anonymous functions
    - function arguments
    - global variables
    - `console.log` for debugging
    - `Math.random()` for random number generation
    - using the `document` API for working with the DOM directly

`index.html` contains the game html elements, `script.js` will
hold all of the game logic, and `style.css` holds all of the styles
for the page (colors, padding, etc)

No installation needed, just open `index.html` in a browser and get
to work!
